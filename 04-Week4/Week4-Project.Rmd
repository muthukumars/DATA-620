# 2. LOAD DATA

# --DATASET 1: edgelist--

nodes <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muthukumars/DATA-620/master/04-Week4/Dataset1-Media-Example-NODES.csv", header=T, as.is=T)
links <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muthukumars/DATA-620/master/04-Week4/Dataset1-Media-Example-EDGES.csv", header=T, as.is=T)

head(nodes)
head(links)

nrow(nodes); length(unique(nodes$id))
nrow(links); nrow(unique(links[,c("from", "to")]))
nrow(unique(links[,c("from", "to", "type")]))

# Collapse multiple links of the same type between the same two nodes
# by summing their weights, using aggregate() by "from", "to", & "type":
links <- aggregate(links[,3], links[,-3], sum)
links <- links[order(links$from, links$to),]
colnames(links)[4] <- "weight"
rownames(links) <- NULL

nrow(links); nrow(unique(links[,c("from", "to")]))

# --DATASET 2: matrix--

nodes2 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muthukumars/DATA-620/master/04-Week4/Dataset2-Media-User-Example-NODES.csv", header=T, as.is=T)
links2 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muthukumars/DATA-620/master/04-Week4/Dataset2-Media-User-Example-EDGES.csv", header=T, row.names=1)

# Examine the data:
head(nodes2)
head(links2)

# links2 is a matrix for a two-mode network:
links2 <- as.matrix(links2)
dim(links2)
dim(nodes2)

# ================ 3. Plotting networks with igraph ================

  
#  ------->> Turning networks into igraph objects  --------

library("igraph")

# DATASET 1 

# Converting the data to an igraph object:
# The graph_from_data_frame() function takes two data frames: 'd' and 'vertices'.
# 'd' describes the edges of the network - it should start with two columns 
# containing the source and target node IDs for each network tie.
# 'vertices' should start with a column of node IDs.
# Any additional columns in either data frame are interpreted as attributes.

net <- graph_from_data_frame(d=links, vertices=nodes, directed=T) 

# Examine the resulting object:
class(net)
net 

# We can access the nodes, edges, and their attributes:
E(net)
V(net)
E(net)$type
V(net)$media

# Or find specific nodes and edges by attribute:
# (that returns objects of type vertex sequence / edge sequence)
V(net)[media=="BBC"]
E(net)[type=="mention"]


# If you need them, you can extract an edge list 
# or a matrix back from the igraph networks.
as_edgelist(net, names=T)
as_adjacency_matrix(net, attr="weight")

# Or data frames describing nodes and edges:
as_data_frame(net, what="edges")
as_data_frame(net, what="vertices")


# You can also look at the network matrix directly:
net[1,]
net[5,7]

# First attempt to plot the graph:
plot(net) # not pretty!

# Removing loops from the graph:
net <- simplify(net, remove.multiple = F, remove.loops = T) 

# Let's and reduce the arrow size and remove the labels:
plot(net, edge.arrow.size=.4,vertex.label=NA)
 


# DATASET 2 


head(nodes2)
head(links2)

# Create an igraph network object from the two-mode matrix: 
net2 <- graph_from_incidence_matrix(links2)

# A built-in vertex attribute 'type' shows which mode vertices belong to.
table(V(net2)$type)

plot(net2,vertex.label=NA)

# Examine the resulting object:
class(net2)
net2

# CALCULATE CENTRALITY MEASURES FOR  DATA Set1

# Indegree centrality measures how many people direct social 
# talk to the individual.
indegree_social <- degree(net, mode='in')
indegree_social
 
# Outdegree centrality measures how many people the actor directs 
# social talk to. 
outdegree_social <- degree(net, mode='out')
outdegree_social
 
# Closeness is the mean geodesic distance between a given node and
# all other nodes with paths from the given node to the other
# node. This is close to being the mean shortest path, but 
# geodesic distances give higher values for more central nodes.
#
# In a directed network, we can think of in-closeness centrality
# as the average number of steps one would have to go through to
# get TO a given node FROM all other reachable nodes in the
# network. Out-closeness centrality, not surprisingly, measures
# the same thing with the directionality reversed.
 
# In-closeness centrality
incloseness_social <- closeness(net, mode='in')
incloseness_social
 
# Out-closeness
outcloseness_social <- closeness(net, mode='out')
